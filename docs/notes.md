### Creep spawning difference by controller level

1 Work = 100 energy
1 Work = 2 energy per tick
Source total:
4000 in center rooms
3000 in an owned or reserved room
1500 in an unreserved room

Regen every 300 ticks

So in non-center, owned rooms, we need to extract 3000 energy every 300 ticks, or 30 energy per tick. So a static miner needs 15 WORK parts and at least 1 MOVE part but ideally more.

So minimum energy is 1550, which isn't available until level 3, which gives us exactly 1550 energy. But since there's a delay between hitting that level and building the extensions, level 3 should still not rely only on static miners.

Imo the demarcation between "new" and "stable" base should be below level 4 then
